# Project Brief: Financial Document Generator

## Introduction
This brief captures a YOLO-mode synthesis of the available documentation in `docs/` to accelerate alignment on the Financial Document Generator initiative. Source material includes the bank statement, payslip, Google Places integration, PDF generation, and configuration specifications that collectively describe the existing solution space.

## Executive Summary
The Financial Document Generator produces lender-grade Australian financial artefacts—bank statements, payslips, and NAB proofs of balance—that align across data sources and withstand compliance scrutiny. It serves loan origination and verification flows by combining configurable data models, realistic transaction synthesis, and pixel-perfect document rendering. The product targets lending teams that need trustworthy supporting evidence and fintech builders who embed automated document experiences.

## Problem Statement
Current lending pipelines rely on applicants manually uploading disparate proofs of income and balance. The artefacts are often inconsistent, mismatched across statements and payslips, or fail to meet regulatory format expectations, triggering rework and delays. Compliance checks require precise Australian regulatory alignment and verifiable merchant data that generic generators cannot provide. Teams need a controlled way to create coherent document sets that mirror real NAB outputs while maintaining auditable traceability across generated artefacts.

## Proposed Solution
Deliver an integrated generation toolkit that lets operators produce bank statements, payslips, and proofs of balance from shared structured inputs. Transaction synthesis respects Australian responsible lending requirements, uses Google Places data for credible merchants, and keeps payslip series in lockstep with bank income records. A TypeScript configuration layer centralises defaults, while Puppeteer-based rendering guarantees pixel-accurate PDFs. The solution emphasizes extensibility so new artefacts or banks can be added without rewriting the generation engine.

## Target Users
### Primary User Segment: Lending Verification & Credit Operations Teams
Professionals inside Australian banks, non-bank lenders, and brokerage partners responsible for verifying applicant documentation. They need compliant, internally generated artefacts to validate workflows, support credit decisioning, and train underwriting teams without exposing real customer data.

### Secondary User Segment: Fintech Product & Engineering Teams
Builders embedding financial document workflows into onboarding or loan-origination products. They require API-accessible document synthesis, realistic test data, and alignment rules to simulate end-to-end experiences and QA integrations before launching to production.

## Goals & Success Metrics
### Business Objectives
- Increase automated document coverage for lender-required artefacts to 3 core document types (bank statements, payslips, proof of balance) with NAB fidelity by Q3.
- Reduce manual underwriting rework caused by document mismatches by 40% for pilot lending teams within the first release cycle.
- Enable downstream product squads to self-serve document generation via a documented configuration interface and CLI flows.

### User Success Metrics
- Borrower-facing teams complete document packages in under 5 minutes using shared inputs.
- QA engineers can regenerate identical document sets with the same seed data, confirming deterministic behaviour.
- Compliance reviewers confirm that generated artefacts pass internal audit spot checks with no critical findings.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- `Document Fidelity Score`: ≥95% match against reference NAB PDFs during pixel diff audits.
- `Alignment Accuracy`: 100% consistency between payslip deposits and statement transactions across generated packages.
- `Generation Throughput`: ≤30 seconds average end-to-end generation time per document bundle in staging environments.

## MVP Scope
### Core Features (Must Have)
- **Linked Artefact Generation:** Shared data model feeds bank statements, payslips, and proofs of balance with consistent identifiers.
- **Compliance-Conscious Transaction Engine:** Implements Australian responsible lending rules, income stability constraints, and NAB-specific formatting.
- **Pixel-Perfect PDF Output:** Puppeteer-based rendering templates for NAB Transaction Listing, Proof of Balance, and Xero-style payslips.
- **Location Realism:** Google Places-powered merchant enrichment with caching and fallbacks for Australian geographies.
- **Configuration Surface:** Centralised TypeScript `config.ts` specification controlling defaults, validation, and UI behaviour.

### Out of Scope for MVP
- Support for non-NAB financial institutions or international formats.
- End-user UI redesign beyond existing generator forms.
- Real-time external data ingestion from banking APIs.
- Automated regulatory filing or submission workflows.

### MVP Success Criteria
The MVP is successful when internal lending stakeholders can produce NAB-aligned statement/payslip bundles from shared inputs, auditors validate compliance adherence, and engineering teams can integrate the generator into CI test suites without manual interventions.

## Post-MVP Vision
### Phase 2 Features
Expand support to additional Australian banks, add automated anomaly detection to flag inconsistent inputs, and expose REST/GraphQL endpoints for programmatic generation.

### Long-term Vision
Deliver a multi-jurisdiction document synthesis platform that adapts templates per region, incorporates biometric and identity artefacts, and plugs into lender LOS ecosystems for straight-through processing.

### Expansion Opportunities
Partnership integrations with verification providers, analytics dashboards for document usage metrics, and template marketplaces for industry-specific document packs.

## Technical Considerations
### Platform Requirements
- **Target Platforms:** Node.js services orchestrating generation, React-based admin/CLI clients.
- **Browser/OS Support:** Chromium headless execution on Linux containers; generated PDFs compatible with standard desktop/mobile viewers.
- **Performance Requirements:** Handle batch generation of 50-document bundles with consistent sub-minute runtimes and memory under 1 GB per worker.

### Technology Preferences
- **Frontend:** React with controlled forms for input capture; Tailwind/CSS modules for styling parity.
- **Backend:** TypeScript/Node.js services orchestrating data synthesis and calling Puppeteer.
- **Database:** JSON configuration persisted in downstream codebase; optional Postgres/Redis layers for caching place data.
- **Hosting/Infrastructure:** Containerised deployment via Docker/Kubernetes with secure secrets management for Google API keys.

### Architecture Considerations
- **Repository Structure:** Maintain documentation artifacts in `docs/`, generation templates alongside service modules, and shared config in `config.ts`.
- **Service Architecture:** Modular utilities for transaction generation, Google API proxy, and PDF rendering to keep responsibilities isolated.
- **Integration Requirements:** Secure proxy for Google Places/Geocoding APIs, CLI (`codex`) for local workflows, and hooks for CI automation.
- **Security/Compliance:** Protect API keys, audit generated data seeds, and ensure generated documents carry disclaimers to prevent misuse.

## Constraints & Assumptions
### Constraints
- **Budget:** Optimise for existing engineering capacity; no dedicated design budget in MVP.
- **Timeline:** MVP targeted within the next quarter (≈12 weeks) to support lending pilot commitments.
- **Resources:** Core team of 1-2 engineers, 1 analyst, shared QA; access to existing BMAD CLI workflows.
- **Technical:** Reliance on Google Places quotas and Chromium-compatible runtime environments.

### Key Assumptions
- Generated documents remain for internal/testing use, not for submission to external regulators without review.
- NAB remains the primary partner bank through MVP; other banks evaluated post-launch.
- Upstream data inputs (employee info, account details) are accurate and provided by trusted internal systems.
- Stakeholders accept CLI-first workflows before broader UI investments.

## Risks & Open Questions
### Key Risks
- **Compliance Drift:** Regulatory updates could invalidate static rules if not actively maintained.
- **Data Authenticity Challenges:** Synthetic merchant data may still trigger manual checks if Place API quotas degrade quality.
- **Operational Overload:** Small team may struggle to support new document types without automation.

### Open Questions
- What governance process will keep lending regulations and template changes up to date?
- Do downstream consumers require webhook notifications when new bundles are generated?
- How will API key management be handled across environments (dev/staging/prod)?

### Areas Needing Further Research
- Evaluate cost and quota implications of scaling Google Places usage.
- Benchmark Puppeteer performance across container environments to validate throughput targets.
- Assess desirability of adding OCR-readable layers for enhanced accessibility/compliance.
