# Story 3.0 Bootstrap Admin UI Shell and Foundation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** frontend platform engineer,
**I want** an authenticated admin UI shell with shared navigation and design system wiring,
**so that** subsequent compliance and operator features can plug into a consistent experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Admin UI bootstraps Next.js (or chosen framework) with authentication guardrails, layout scaffolding, and navigation patterns.
2. Shared design system components (e.g., typography, buttons, tables) align with `docs/user-interface-design-goals.md` and are ready for reuse.
3. Role-based routing restricts access to protected views and displays fallback messaging for unauthorised users.
4. Developer documentation describes UI architecture, component conventions, and contribution workflow.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Initialise admin UI shell with authentication hooks, persistent navigation, and layout primitives (AC: 1)
- [ ] Wire design system components and tokens consistent with UX guidelines (AC: 2)
- [ ] Implement role-aware routing with error states for unauthorised access (AC: 3)
- [ ] Document UI architecture and contribution workflow for future stories (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
- Follow frontend architecture guidance in `docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md` and design goals doc.
- Coordinate with Story 3.1 to ensure gating experiences reuse the shared components delivered here.
- Ensure linting, testing, and Storybook (if used) integrate with monorepo build tooling.

### Testing
- Add unit/component tests verifying layout rendering, auth guards, and navigation state.
- Include Playwright smoke tests covering login, role-based redirects, and 403 messaging.
