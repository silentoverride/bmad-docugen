# Story 3.6 Automate Environment Provisioning and Release Promotion

## Status
Draft (Multi-sprint)

## Story
**As a** platform operations lead,
**I want** infrastructure-as-code and promotion workflows for DocuGen environments,
**so that** deployments remain reproducible, auditable, and low-risk.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Infrastructure-as-code provisions core services (orchestrator, workers, storage, monitoring) across dev, staging, and production.
2. Promotion pipeline enforces change approvals, smoke tests, and rollback procedures for each environment.
3. Environment configuration (secrets references, feature flags, scaling limits) is version-controlled and peer reviewed.
4. Runbooks document promotion steps, rollback triggers, and escalation paths.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Author IaC modules covering compute, queue, storage, and observability resources per environment (AC: 1)
- [ ] Implement promotion pipeline with approvals, automated smoke checks, and rollback hooks (AC: 2)
- [ ] Store environment configuration in repo with code review safeguards and drift detection (AC: 3)
- [ ] Create and publish promotion/rollback runbooks with escalation details (AC: 4)

## Delivery plan
- Sprint 1: stand up IaC modules for compute, queue, storage, and observability resources with reviewable configuration baselines.
- Sprint 2: build the promotion pipeline with approval gates, smoke tests, and automated rollback hooks across environments.
- Sprint 3: harden configuration governance, wire drift detection, and publish the promotion/rollback runbooks with audit evidence capture.

## Dev Notes
- Align infrastructure components with assumptions in `docs/prd/technical-assumptions.md` and Epic 3 stories for logging and packaging.
- Integrate with secrets rotation story to ensure environment configs reference managed secrets.
- Capture evidence of pipeline runs for auditors per Epic 5 requirements.

## Cross-epic dependencies
- Epic 5 â€“ Story 5.2 depends on promotion evidence capture to satisfy automated audit retention requirements.

### Testing
- Execute IaC plan/apply in sandbox environments and validate drift detection alerts.
- Run staged deployment rehearsals to exercise rollback and smoke test checkpoints.
