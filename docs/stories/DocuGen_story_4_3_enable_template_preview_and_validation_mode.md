# Story 4.3 Enable Template Preview and Validation Mode

## Status
Draft (Multi-sprint)

## Story
**As a** docops specialist,
**I want** a sandboxed preview mode for templates with reconciliation checkpoints,
**so that** I can validate layout changes and data alignment before promoting them to production use.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `docugen templates preview` executes a dry-run render with deterministic seeds, producing PDFs and diff artefacts without touching production manifests.
2. Preflight validation checks ensure new templates respect reconciliation, identifier reuse, and compliance flagging rules.
3. Admin UI surfaces preview artefacts, diff reports, and validation status for stakeholder review.
4. Monitoring emits preview run metrics (duration, diff outcomes, rule violations) and retains them for 30 days.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement preview execution path in CLI/worker stack producing isolated artefacts (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Generate diff artefacts comparing preview output to golden fixtures (AC: 1)
- [ ] Extend validation engine to run reconciliation and compliance checks in preview mode (AC: 2)
- [ ] Add admin UI screens for preview artefact review, including diff visualisation (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Wire WebSocket/event stream updates for preview status (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Document UX updates in `docs/user-interface-design-goals.md` and admin UI handbook (AC: 3)
- [ ] Emit preview metrics and retention configuration in observability stack (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Update monitoring dashboards and alert thresholds (`docs/architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md`) (AC: 4)

## Delivery plan
- Sprint 1: implement the CLI/worker preview execution path and diff artefact generation for deterministic dry runs.
- Sprint 2: extend validation engines with reconciliation and compliance checks aligned to responsible lending rules.
- Sprint 3: surface preview artefacts in the admin UI and wire telemetry retention and alerting in observability stacks.

## Dev Notes
- CLI orchestrator and worker interactions are detailed in `docs/architecture/components.md#cli-orchestrator` and `docs/architecture/components.md#render-worker-pool`.
- Validation rules and reconciliation expectations appear in `docs/prd/epic-2-compliance-grade-document-synthesis.md` and should be reused in preview mode.
- Observability patterns for metrics and alerts are in `docs/architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md` and `docs/architecture/deployment-architecture.md`.
- Admin UI structure (Next.js + shadcn) is described in `docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md`; follow component/state guidelines there.

## Cross-epic dependencies
- Epic 2 – Story 2.1 supplies responsible lending rules that the preview validation path must execute.
- Epic 3 – Stories 3.1 and 3.4 provide gating UX patterns and observability dashboards reused for preview telemetry.

### Testing
- Add unit tests for preview command path and validation branching (`pnpm test:unit`).
- Extend integration/e2e tests to simulate preview renders and diff outputs, leveraging Playwright snapshot tooling per `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`.
- Verify metrics emission via local Prometheus/Grafana setup and ensure retention policies are exercised in automated checks.
