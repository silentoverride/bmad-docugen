# Story 3.2 Persist Audit Logs and Secure Storage

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** compliance auditor,
**I want** immutable logs, manifests, and bundle artefacts stored securely,
**so that** audits can reconstruct any run with full provenance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Structured logs emit to AWS CloudWatch (or equivalent) with trace ids linking CLI actions, rule evaluations, and packaging events.
2. Manifests and bundles persist to S3 with KMS encryption, retention policies, and integrity hashes checked on retrieval.
3. Access logs capture every download or manifest view with operator identity and timestamp.
4. Disaster recovery procedure documents restoration steps and validates quarterly via tabletop exercise.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Configure structured logging with trace ids spanning CLI, rules, and packaging events (AC: 1)
- [ ] Persist manifests and bundles to encrypted storage with retention and integrity checks (AC: 2)
- [ ] Record access logs for downloads and manifest views including operator identity (AC: 3)
- [ ] Author DR runbook and schedule quarterly tabletop validation (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
- Align storage implementation with `docs/architecture/components.md#manifest-service` and `docs/architecture/deployment-architecture.md`.
- Coordinate with security to ensure retention policies meet compliance mandates outlined in `docs/prd/requirements.md`.
- Work with SRE to structure tabletop exercises and evidence collection for audits.

### Testing
- Integrate audit log verification into end-to-end tests by simulating download and manifest access events.
- Add automated checks verifying KMS-encrypted objects and integrity hash validation in staging environments.
