# Story 4.2 Publish Developer Workspace and Sample Bundles

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** partner integration engineer,
**I want** curated sample seeds, fixtures, and automation scripts,
**so that** I can prototype DocuGen extensions quickly and understand expected outputs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Versioned fixture bundles with aligned manifests live under `tests/fixtures/templates` and cover multi-artefact runs.
2. `pnpm workspace:demo` spins up the Compose stack, loads fixtures, and renders bundles for inspection within ten minutes.
3. Documentation explains how to swap fixtures, update manifests, and replay runs via CLI and admin UI.
4. Telemetry tags fixture-driven runs to separate them from production-like workloads for observability dashboards.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Curate fixture bundles with manifests and seed data for statements, payslips, and proofs of balance (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Store fixtures under `tests/fixtures/templates` with README describing usage (AC: 1)
- [ ] Implement `pnpm workspace:demo` script orchestrating Compose startup, fixture loading, and bundle rendering (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Validate command completes within ten minutes on reference hardware (AC: 2)
- [ ] Document end-to-end workflow in developer docs and admin UI help panels (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Update `docs/architecture/development-workflow.md` and add admin UI help entry referencing workspace demo (AC: 3)
- [ ] Emit telemetry tags and dashboards distinguishing demo runs from production (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Update observability configuration in `docs/architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md` if needed (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
- Fixture placement should align with monorepo layout defined in `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md` and `docs/architecture/development-workflow.md`.
- Compose stack expectations, including service ports and dependent containers, live in `docs/architecture/deployment-architecture.md` and `docs/architecture/components.md` (CLI orchestrator, admin UI).
- Telemetry requirements for demo vs. production workloads are documented in `docs/architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md`; reuse existing label conventions.
- Ensure documentation cross-links from `docs/brief.md` and PRD epics so teams discover the workspace flow.

### Testing
- Execute `pnpm workspace:demo` within CI dry-run or smoke suite; add assertions to `pnpm test:integration` to verify fixture bundling success.
- If admin UI changes are required, add Playwright scenarios per `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`.
- Validate logging/metric tags via local Prometheus/Grafana dashboards.
