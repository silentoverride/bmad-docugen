# Story 4.4 Enable Partner Onboarding and API Access

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** partner success manager,
**I want** a streamlined onboarding flow for API consumers with sample assets and governance guardrails,
**so that** external teams can integrate DocuGen quickly while respecting compliance constraints.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Partner onboarding checklist covers account creation, API credential issuance, and environment access approvals.
2. Starter kits (Postman collection, sample configs, walkthrough video) demonstrate end-to-end API usage.
3. Rate limits, quota policies, and support escalation paths are documented and surfaced to partners.
4. Compliance review ensures onboarding materials and credential workflows meet audit requirements.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Define onboarding workflow covering account vetting, credential provisioning, and approval checkpoints (AC: 1)
- [ ] Produce partner starter kit assets including Postman collection, sample configs, and recorded walkthrough (AC: 2)
- [ ] Document rate limits, quotas, and support escalation in partner guide and admin UI (AC: 3)
- [ ] Run compliance review and capture sign-off on onboarding assets and credential policies (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
- Align onboarding documentation with API surfaces delivered in Story 1.4 and packaging expectations from Story 3.3.
- Collaborate with legal/compliance for vetting requirements and data usage agreements.
- Ensure partner assets remain version-controlled and tied to release notes for visibility.

## Cross-epic dependencies
- Epic 1 – Story 1.4 provides the generation API endpoints that partner onboarding exercises.
- Epic 3 – Story 3.3 supplies the signed bundle packaging and delivery flows referenced in partner guides.

### Testing
- Pilot onboarding with an internal partner persona to validate clarity and timing.
- Collect feedback metrics (time to first successful call, support questions) to iterate on materials.
