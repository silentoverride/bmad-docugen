# Story 5.2 Automate Evidence Collection and Retention

## Status
Draft (Multi-sprint)

## Story
**As an** internal auditor,
**I want** DocuGen to automatically package artefacts that prove control execution,
**so that** audits can be satisfied without manual evidence hunts.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Evidence collector aggregates manifests, validation logs, and diff artefacts into signed bundles stored in MinIO with retention policies.
2. Operators can request evidence snapshots via CLI or admin UI, receiving expiring links within two minutes.
3. Every evidence bundle references the originating rule set version, run manifest, and operator identity.
4. Monitoring alerts when evidence collection fails or retention windows near expiry.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement evidence collector service aggregating manifest, validation, and diff artefacts (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Persist bundles in MinIO with retention configuration and signatures (AC: 1)
- [ ] Add CLI/admin UI flows to request evidence bundles and deliver expiring links (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Update admin UI copy and CLI help text to explain evidence retrieval (AC: 2)
- [ ] Link evidence bundles to compliance rule versions and manifests (AC: 3)
- [ ] Configure monitoring alerts for collection failures and retention thresholds (AC: 4)

## Delivery plan
- Sprint 1: implement the evidence collector service, storage retention policies, and signing workflows.
- Sprint 2: add CLI and admin UI retrieval flows with operator communications and documentation updates.
- Sprint 3: connect evidence bundles to rule and manifest metadata and configure observability alerts for failures and expiry windows.

## Dev Notes
- Storage and manifest expectations are defined in `docs/prd/epic-3-operational-delivery-observability.md` (Stories 3.2 and 3.3) and `docs/architecture/components.md#manifest-service`.
- Object storage stack (MinIO) and signing approach are documented in `docs/architecture/deployment-architecture.md` and `docs/architecture/security-and-performance.md`.
- Ensure CLI/admin UI flows align with UX principles in `docs/user-interface-design-goals.md`.
- Alerting patterns should follow guidance in `docs/architecture/monitoring-and-observability.md` and leverage Prometheus/Grafana.

## Cross-epic dependencies
- Epic 3 â€“ Stories 3.2 and 3.3 provide the manifest storage and signed bundle delivery flows that evidence collection must reuse.

### Testing
- Add integration tests verifying evidence bundle contents and signature validation (`pnpm test:integration`).
- Extend Playwright scenarios to cover admin UI evidence request flow.
- Simulate failure/expiry scenarios to confirm alerts fire as expected in local observability stack.
