# Story 3.5 Implement Secrets Management and Rotation Controls

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** security engineer,
**I want** automated secrets storage and rotation controls for DocuGen services,
**so that** integrations remain compliant without manual intervention or exposure risk.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Secrets for external services (Google Places, storage, signing keys) reside in managed vault tooling with audit logging.
2. Rotation workflows automate key refresh and propagate updates without redeploying core services.
3. Alerting warns operators before secret expiry and when rotation attempts fail.
4. Documentation details rotation cadence, emergency procedures, and responsible owners.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Integrate secrets vault (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager) with audit logging for all external credentials (AC: 1)
- [ ] Implement automated rotation pipelines and service reload mechanisms avoiding downtime (AC: 2)
- [ ] Configure alerts for upcoming expiries and failed rotations, routed to on-call teams (AC: 3)
- [ ] Document rotation processes, ownership, and emergency steps (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
- Align with NFR5 in `docs/prd/requirements.md` and security guidelines in `docs/architecture/security-and-performance.md`.
- Coordinate with operations to integrate rotation events into incident management tooling.
- Ensure manifests and logs never expose secret values during rotation testing.

### Testing
- Run automated rotation smoke tests in staging environments validating seamless credential swaps.
- Add unit/integration tests ensuring services reload updated secrets without full restart when possible.
