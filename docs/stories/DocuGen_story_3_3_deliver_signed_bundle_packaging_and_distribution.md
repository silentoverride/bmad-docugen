# Story 3.3 Deliver Signed Bundle Packaging and Distribution

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** fintech integrator,
**I want** signed archives and controlled delivery endpoints,
**so that** downstream systems can trust and automate bundle ingestion.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Bundles compress into signed archives containing PDFs, manifest, reconciliation report, and checksums.
2. Delivery endpoint supports expiring pre-signed URLs and optional webhook notification with metadata payload.
3. Integrity verification script allows recipients to confirm signatures and checksums locally.
4. Packaging step maintains ≤30 second SLA when invoked sequentially with two other runs.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement packaging pipeline producing signed archives with manifests and reconciliation reports (AC: 1)
- [ ] Expose delivery endpoint issuing expiring pre-signed URLs and optional webhook notifications (AC: 2)
- [ ] Provide verification script/documentation for recipients to validate signatures and checksums (AC: 3)
- [ ] Benchmark packaging flow with sequential runs to confirm ≤30 second SLA (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
- Coordinate with compliance requirements in `docs/prd/requirements.md` FR7 for packaging specifics.
- Ensure webhook payload contracts are documented for partner integration teams.
- Reuse manifest integrity hashes output by Story 1.2 to avoid redundant calculations.

## Cross-epic dependencies
- Epic 1 – Story 1.2 provides the manifest integrity hashes reused during signed bundle packaging.

### Testing
- Add integration tests that package bundles and validate signatures/checksums in CI.
- Simulate sequential runs in performance tests to track SLA adherence.
