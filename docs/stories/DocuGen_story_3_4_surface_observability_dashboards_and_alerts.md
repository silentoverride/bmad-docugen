# Story 3.4 Surface Observability Dashboards and Alerts

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** site reliability engineer,
**I want** dashboards and threshold-based alerts for generation health,
**so that** we detect and resolve SLA or compliance regressions before they impact stakeholders.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Grafana (or equivalent) dashboard visualises throughput, failure rates, rule violations, and pixel diff metrics in near real-time.
2. Alerting policies trigger notifications when generation duration, failure rate, or fidelity metrics breach agreed thresholds.
3. Dashboard links into run manifests for deep-dive investigation in a single click.
4. Runbook documents remediation steps for top five failure modes and is tested via quarterly drills.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Build dashboards covering throughput, failure rates, rule violations, and pixel diff metrics (AC: 1)
- [ ] Configure alerts for SLA breaches and compliance regressions with notification routing (AC: 2)
- [ ] Link dashboard panels directly to manifests for fast investigation (AC: 3)
- [ ] Write and exercise remediation runbook during quarterly drills (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
- Align metrics schema with outputs from Stories 2.3 and 3.1 to ensure observability parity.
- Coordinate with operations to define alert thresholds and escalation policies.
- Ensure dashboard assets are version-controlled under `infra/` or equivalent to support reproducibility.

## Cross-epic dependencies
- Epic 2 â€“ Story 2.3 streams pixel fidelity metrics that populate the observability dashboards.

### Testing
- Use automated smoke tests or synthetic checks to trigger alert rules in staging and verify routing.
- Capture dashboard exports or snapshots as artefacts during CI validation runs.
