# Checklist Results Report
The Architect validation (2025-09-26) rated the solution **High readiness**. All checklist sections were reviewed with the following outcomes:

| Section | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Requirements Alignment | ✅ | Functional/non-functional requirements mapped to components, workflows, and observability. |
| Architecture Fundamentals | ✅ | Monorepo layout, diagrams, and service boundaries clearly documented. |
| Data & Integration Design | ✅ | Entities, OpenAPI schema, Redis split, and Google Places integration covered. |
| Security & Compliance | ⚠️ | Vault fallback documented; ongoing operational vigilance required (see `docs/runbooks/vault-outage.md`). |
| Performance & Scalability | ⚠️ | Resource demands and Redis queue/cache isolation addressed; monitor developer hardware guidance. |
| Observability & Operations | ✅ | Prometheus/Loki/Grafana stack, runbooks, and push-gateway integration defined. |
| AI Implementation Suitability | ✅ | Coding standards, naming conventions, and examples tailored for automation agents. |
| Accessibility (Frontend) | ⚠️ | UX spec ensures WCAG alignment; future automation should enforce accessibility tests. |

Outstanding watch items:
- Continue refining override approval UX to enforce dual-approval ergonomics.
- Monitor audit-retention job metrics and adjust retention windows as real data dictates.
- Review hardware footprint after longer test runs and update onboarding guidance if necessary.
