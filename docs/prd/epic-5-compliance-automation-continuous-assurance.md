# Epic 5 Compliance Automation & Continuous Assurance
Deliver automated controls, evidence capture, and reporting so DocuGen continuously demonstrates adherence to responsible lending, security, and audit requirements without manual intervention.

## Story 5.1 Versioned Compliance Rule Library
As a compliance architect,
I want a version-controlled rules engine with documented change management,
so that regulatory updates propagate safely across DocuGen surfaces.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Compliance rules live in a dedicated package with semantic versioning, changelog, and dependency graph annotations.
2: CLI command `docugen compliance diff` compares rule versions, highlighting breaking and additive changes with linked documentation.
3: Regression suite covers baseline scenarios (income variance, merchant blacklist, template guardrails) and runs in CI on rule updates.
4: Rule metadata records effective dates and approval signatures for audit review.

## Story 5.2 Automate Evidence Collection and Retention
As an internal auditor,
I want DocuGen to automatically package artefacts that prove control execution,
so that audits can be satisfied without manual evidence hunts.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Evidence collector aggregates manifests, validation logs, and diff artefacts into signed bundles stored in MinIO with retention policies.
2: Operators can request evidence snapshots via CLI or admin UI, receiving expiring links within two minutes.
3: Every evidence bundle references the originating rule set version, run manifest, and operator identity.
4: Monitoring alerts when evidence collection fails or retention windows near expiry.

## Story 5.3 Surface Continuous Compliance Dashboards
As a risk officer,
I want dashboards that track control health, outstanding violations, and remediation velocity,
so that I can govern DocuGen without digging into raw logs.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Admin UI ships a compliance dashboard summarising rule pass/fail trends, waiver counts, and time-to-resolution metrics.
2: Prometheus/Grafana dashboards visualise compliance KPIs and feed alert thresholds for sustained failures.
3: Dashboard tiles link to evidence bundles and manifests for drill-down investigations.
4: Access control ensures only authorised compliance roles can view sensitive metrics and waive findings.
