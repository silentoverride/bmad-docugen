# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Deliver a unified generator that produces NAB-fidelity bank statements, payslips, and proofs of balance from shared structured inputs.
- Cut manual underwriting rework caused by mismatched artefacts by enabling tightly aligned, compliance-ready document bundles.
- Provide lending and fintech teams with deterministic, self-serve configuration, API, and CLI surfaces for rapid document package creation.
- Guarantee operators can assemble lender-ready document packs in under five minutes while preserving auditability and traceability.
- Ensure generated artefacts meet internal compliance and audit spot checks with ≥95% fidelity to NAB references.

## Background Context
Loan-origination teams currently juggle applicant-uploaded documents that vary in format, accuracy, and regulatory compliance. The resulting rework slows approvals and erodes trust. The Financial Document Generator addresses this by synchronising key artefacts—statements, payslips, and proofs of balance—around common datasets, Australian responsible lending rules, and verified merchant information.

By pairing a TypeScript configuration layer with Puppeteer-driven rendering, the solution keeps document templates pixel-perfect, ensures deposits and balances align across artefacts, and gives both internal lenders and fintech partners a reproducible way to create testing and training materials without exposing customer data.
