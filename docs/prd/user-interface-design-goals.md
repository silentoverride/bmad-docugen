# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Empower internal operators to trigger deterministic document bundles via CLI workflows and internal admin forms that surface run readiness, validation errors, and rendered artefact previews without requiring deep technical knowledge.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- Guided CLI prompts with configuration validation and inline remediation hints.
- Admin web view surfacing latest bundle history, manifest metadata, and PDF previews for compliance review.
- Read-only dashboards for lending stakeholders summarising bundle status, SLA adherence, and audit flags.

## Core Screens and Views
- CLI run summary output that highlights validation outcomes, document links, and packaging status.
- Document bundle detail page with PDF preview carousel and reconciled totals cross-check.
- Audit trail explorer showing manifests, logs, and hash verification for completed runs.

## Accessibility: None
CLI-first workflows and internal admin tools inherit standard accessibility from shared component library; no external WCAG commitments required at this stage.

## Branding
- Generated PDFs replicate NAB artefact styling and typography to maintain lender familiarity.
- Internal admin UI reuses existing Codex CLI palette with NAB accents on preview elements for context.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Admin review tooling remains web responsive for desktop-first usage while enabling tablet access during audits.
