# Risk Profile: Story 1.5

Date: 2025-09-26
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 45/100

Story 1.5 provisions the worker queue execution backbone. Maintaining deterministic outputs while scaling concurrency and resilience is the central challenge. Queue orchestration touches every upstream interface (CLI, API) and becomes the gatekeeper for SLAs, so failures ripple throughout the platform.

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. DATA-006: Deterministic Output Drift Under Concurrent Execution
**Score:** 9 (Critical)

- **Probability:** High (3) – Parallel workers often introduce non-deterministic ordering, environment variance, or shared-resource contention unless carefully controlled.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Violates DocuGen’s core promise of reproducibility, breaks checksum comparisons, and invalidates compliance evidence.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Enforce immutable job payloads and deterministic seeds passed from orchestrator.
  - Serialise side effects (e.g., file writes) or use idempotent partitioning per job.
  - Add regression tests comparing queue-driven outputs with direct CLI/API runs for identical inputs.
- **Testing Focus:** Concurrency stress tests verifying binary equivalence and manifest hash stability across repeated queued runs.

## High-Risk Items

### 2. TECH-006: Retry & Backoff Policies Cause Duplicate or Lost Jobs
**Score:** 6 (High)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – Misconfigured retry strategies can rerun partial jobs or drop them after transient failures.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Duplicated renders waste capacity and confuse operators; lost jobs breach SLAs and undermine trust.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Design idempotent job handlers with explicit job state machine (pending, running, succeeded, failed, dead-letter).
  - Configure exponential backoff with jitter and capped retries; add dead-letter queue plus alerting.
  - Include automated chaos tests injecting failures to validate retry behaviour.
- **Testing Focus:** Fault-injection integration tests validating retry, deduplication, and dead-letter handling.

### 3. PERF-004: Queue Saturation & Backpressure Collapse SLAs
**Score:** 6 (High)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – Launch demand spikes or partner bursts can exceed default concurrency settings.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Leads to prolonged processing delays, violating concurrency SLAs and forcing manual intervention.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Implement adaptive concurrency controls and queue length-based autoscaling hooks.
  - Define backpressure signalling to callers (API 429 responses, CLI messaging) when saturation occurs.
  - Monitor processing time percentiles and set alert thresholds tied to SLA commitments.
- **Testing Focus:** Load tests modelling burst traffic and verifying autoscaling/backpressure behaviour.

### 4. SEC-004: Worker Credential Leakage or Over-Privileged Roles
**Score:** 6 (High)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – Queue workers often require access to storage buckets and signing keys; broad roles or mismanaged secrets are common early on.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Credential compromise grants attackers ability to generate or tamper with artefacts, undermining security posture.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Store secrets in managed vault/KMS, scope IAM roles to least privilege per worker.
  - Rotate credentials automatically; audit access logs and enforce MFA for operator overrides.
  - Conduct security review covering queue infrastructure and worker containers.
- **Testing Focus:** Security tests validating secret injection, rotation, and least-privilege policies.

## Medium-Risk Items

### 5. OPS-005: Observability Gaps for Queue Health Metrics
**Score:** 4 (Medium)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – Dashboards and alerts often lag behind queue enablement.
- **Impact:** Medium (2) – Without visibility into depth, latency, and failure rates, teams cannot detect SLA breaches early.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Instrument queue metrics (depth, processing time, retry counts) and log correlation IDs back to manifests.
  - Build dashboards with alerting on SLO thresholds; integrate with Story 3.4 observability stack.
  - Run operational readiness reviews before production enablement.
- **Testing Focus:** Observability smoke tests verifying metrics export, alert firing, and dashboard coverage.

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical & High Risks
- Concurrency regression suite comparing queued vs direct outputs (DATA-006).
- Fault injection tests covering retries, deduplication, and dead-letter flows (TECH-006).
- Load and rate tests exercising saturation plus backpressure signalling (PERF-004).
- Security validation of worker secret management and least-privilege access (SEC-004).

### Priority 2: Medium Risks
- Observability validation ensuring dashboards, alerts, and traces capture queue health (OPS-005).

### Priority 3: Baseline Regression
- Smoke tests verifying job submission from CLI/API through to completion.
- Integration tests ensuring queue metrics feed manifests and audit logs.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- DATA-006 must be mitigated to guarantee deterministic outcomes under load.
- SEC-004 must meet security review standards before granting production credentials.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- TECH-006 acceptable with robust retry/dedup instrumentation and dead-letter monitoring.
- PERF-004 acceptable when autoscaling and backpressure controls are operational with active alerting.
- OPS-005 acceptable with temporary runbooks and committed observability backlog.

### Accepted Risks
- None accepted at this stage.

## Monitoring Requirements
- Track queue depth, processing latency percentiles, retry counts, and failure classes.
- Monitor manifest hash comparisons for queued vs direct runs.
- Alert on credential usage anomalies and failed secret rotations.

## Risk Review Triggers
- Changes to queue concurrency, worker images, or infrastructure scaling policies.
- Integration of new artefact types or larger payload sizes.
- Incident post-mortems indicating retry/backoff or observability gaps.

## Recommendations Summary
- Lock down deterministic controls before scaling concurrency beyond baseline workloads.
- Mature retry, dead-letter, and autoscaling strategies with chaos testing.
- Harden worker security posture and observability to keep SLAs defensible.
