# Risk Profile: Story 4.1

Date: 2025-09-26
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 40/100

The template authoring toolkit becomes the entry point for extensions. If scaffolded packages drift from shared schema or deterministic patterns, DocuGen loses control over artefact fidelity. The most severe risk is generating templates that bypass schema alignment, leading to data inconsistencies.

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. DATA-016: Scaffolded Templates Bypass Shared Schema Contracts
**Score:** 9 (Critical)

- **Probability:** High (3) – Developers may modify generated stubs or scaffolds might miss new schema fields.
- **Impact:** High (3) – New templates ship with mismatched placeholders, causing compliance errors across bundles.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Generate TypeScript types directly from schema sources; block edits to generated files.
  - Add scaffold validation tests ensuring placeholder coverage and deterministic binding.
  - Require CI checks for scaffolded projects verifying schema parity before publication.
- **Testing Focus:** Integration tests running scaffold command then validating placeholder mapping; schema diff automation.

## High-Risk Items

### 2. TECH-013: Scaffold Command Produces Non-Deterministic Outputs
**Score:** 6 (High)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – Local environment differences (e.g., timestamps) can leak into generated packages.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Deterministic guarantees break, complicating reviews and causing git noise.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use canonicalized timestamps, template versioning, and stable sorting in generator.
  - Add snapshot tests diffing scaffold outputs across runs.
  - Provide verification command to audit existing packages for determinism.
- **Testing Focus:** Snapshot comparison tests; determinism checks in CI.

### 3. SEC-012: Scaffolded Projects Introduce Unsanitised Build Scripts
**Score:** 6 (High)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – Boilerplate can inadvertently expose dev server ports or insecure sample code.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Security posture degrades; partner extensions propagate insecure patterns.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Limit scaffold to vetted scripts; run dependency audit during generation.
  - Document secure coding requirements; include security linting defaults.
  - Run security scanning on generated projects in CI.
- **Testing Focus:** Static analysis on scaffolded code; dependency audit tests.

### 4. OPS-017: CI Workflow for Scaffold Validation Becomes Flaky
**Score:** 6 (High)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – Integration workflow may rely on heavy rendering causing long runtimes.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Teams disable validation, letting broken templates ship.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Optimise workflow with caching, selective test execution, and clear failure diagnostics.
  - Monitor CI duration and failure rates; alert when thresholds breached.
  - Provide local reproduction scripts for developers.
- **Testing Focus:** CI observability tests; performance benchmarks of scaffold validation job.

## Medium-Risk Items

### 5. BUS-012: Documentation Fails to Convey Guardrails for External Teams
**Score:** 4 (Medium)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – Documentation may lag behind tooling updates.
- **Impact:** Medium (2) – Partners misuse toolkit leading to support load and inconsistent artefacts.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Version docs with toolkit releases; add quickstart and anti-pattern sections.
  - Gather feedback from pilot partners; update docs accordingly.
  - Link docs from CLI output and admin UI workspace.
- **Testing Focus:** Documentation review; pilot onboarding sessions.

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical & High Risks
- Schema parity and placeholder coverage tests for generated templates (DATA-016).
- Determinism snapshot tests and security scans on scaffold outputs (TECH-013, SEC-012).
- CI workflow load monitoring and reliability tests (OPS-017).

### Priority 2: Medium Risks
- Documentation pilots and review cycles (BUS-012).

### Priority 3: Baseline Regression
- Smoke tests running scaffold → preview → checksum pipeline end to end.
- CLI unit tests to ensure consistent flags and outputs.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- DATA-016 safeguards must guarantee schema-aligned templates.
- TECH-013/SEC-012 controls must demonstrate deterministic, secure scaffold outputs.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- OPS-017 acceptable with CI monitoring and fallback workflows.
- BUS-012 acceptable if documentation backlog is tracked and updated per release.

### Accepted Risks
- None accepted currently.

## Monitoring Requirements
- Track scaffold command usage, validation job failures, and documentation feedback tickets.
- Monitor dependency vulnerability scans on generated projects.

## Risk Review Triggers
- Schema updates introducing new fields or artefacts.
- Toolkit release adding new template types or renderers.
- Partner feedback indicating scaffold confusion or security concerns.

## Recommendations Summary
- Keep scaffold outputs tightly coupled to shared schema and determinism requirements.
- Bake security and reliability checks into the generation pipeline.
- Maintain documentation and CI workflows so partners can extend safely.
