# Risk Profile: Story 5.3

Date: 2025-09-26
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 42/100

Continuous compliance dashboards surface sensitive governance metrics. The primary risk is exposing dashboards to unauthorised users, leaking regulatory data and waiver details.

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-018: Compliance Dashboards Accessible to Unauthorised Roles
**Score:** 9 (Critical)

- **Probability:** High (3) – RBAC alignment between admin UI and observability often lags, especially for new dashboards.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Sensitive compliance posture leaks; waivers or violations become public internally or externally.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Implement fine-grained RBAC with Keycloak scopes mirrored in UI/API and Grafana dashboards.
  - Add automated access tests; audit logs for every dashboard view.
  - Require security review before promoting dashboards.
- **Testing Focus:** Security/access tests, penetration tests on dashboard endpoints.

## High-Risk Items

### 2. DATA-022: Metrics & Tiles Display Stale or Inaccurate Compliance KPIs
**Score:** 6 (High)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – Aggregation pipelines may lag or mis-handle waiver updates.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Risk officers make incorrect decisions; auditors question data accuracy.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Validate metrics via reconciliation against evidence store; alert on mismatches.
  - Include freshness indicators and last-updated timestamps on dashboard.
  - Add automated tests comparing dashboard aggregates to underlying data samples.
- **Testing Focus:** Integration tests verifying metric accuracy; data reconciliation scripts.

### 3. TECH-017: Dashboard Links to Evidence Bundles Break
**Score:** 6 (High)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – Evidence retrieval APIs may evolve without updating dashboard links.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Investigations stall; operators resort to manual searches.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use shared link builder utilities; add contract tests for dashboard links.
  - Monitor link failure rates with Sentry/analytics.
  - Provide fallback fetch flow inside dashboard when API evolves.
- **Testing Focus:** UI integration tests verifying link resolution; monitoring of 404/403 rates.

### 4. OPS-023: Alert Noise Causes Dashboard Fatigue
**Score:** 6 (High)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – Excess alerts on compliance KPIs can desensitise responders.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Real violations ignored, allowing prolonged non-compliance.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Apply SLO-based alerting; include suppression windows and deduplication.
  - Review alert thresholds quarterly with risk officers.
  - Track alert acknowledgement vs resolution metrics; tune accordingly.
- **Testing Focus:** Synthetic alert tests measuring routing/ack; monitoring alert volume.

## Medium-Risk Items

### 5. BUS-018: Waiver Governance Workflow Not Reflected in Dashboard Controls
**Score:** 4 (Medium)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – UI controls may allow waivers without capturing justification or approval chain.
- **Impact:** Medium (2) – Auditors challenge waiver validity; manual reconciliation required.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Require waiver actions to capture justification, approver, and expiry linked to evidence.
  - Log waiver events and surface in compliance evidence store.
  - Add reporting to track waiver backlog and expiry.
- **Testing Focus:** UI/UX tests for waiver creation; evidence reconciliation checks.

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical & High Risks
- RBAC penetration tests for dashboard access (SEC-018).
- Metric reconciliation and freshness monitoring tests (DATA-022).
- UI contract tests ensuring evidence links resolve and alerts fire appropriately (TECH-017, OPS-023).

### Priority 2: Medium Risks
- Waiver workflow QA ensuring justification/approvals captured (BUS-018).

### Priority 3: Baseline Regression
- Smoke tests covering dashboard rendering, filtering, and waiver actions under different roles.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- SEC-018 access controls must be proven with automated tests and audits.
- DATA-022/TECH-017/OPS-023 mitigations must demonstrate accurate metrics, reliable links, and tuned alerting.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- BUS-018 acceptable when waiver workflow backlog is tracked and reviewed.

### Accepted Risks
- None accepted currently.

## Monitoring Requirements
- Track dashboard access logs, KPI freshness, link failure rates, and alert volumes.
- Monitor waiver creation/expiry metrics and evidence linkage.

## Risk Review Triggers
- New compliance metrics or waivers introduced.
- RBAC changes, dashboard restructuring, or observability tooling migrations.
- Audit findings referencing dashboard accuracy or access.

## Recommendations Summary
- Lock down dashboard access rigorously and validate through automation.
- Keep metrics accurate and timely with reconciliation and freshness monitoring.
- Maintain reliable evidence links, tuned alerting, and auditable waiver workflows.
