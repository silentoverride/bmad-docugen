# Risk Profile: Story 4.2

Date: 2025-09-26
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 41/100

Publishing the developer workspace introduces curated fixtures and automation targeted at partners. The highest exposure is accidentally including sensitive or production-derived data in sample bundles.

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-013: Sample Fixtures Contain Sensitive or Production Data
**Score:** 9 (Critical)

- **Probability:** High (3) – Teams often bootstrap fixtures from anonymised exports that may retain identifiers.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Violates privacy obligations and could leak customer details to partners.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Automate sanitisation checks ensuring fixtures use synthetic data; integrate with CI.
  - Require compliance sign-off for fixture updates; maintain provenance documentation.
  - Store fixtures in dedicated repo branch with restricted write access.
- **Testing Focus:** Static scans for PII patterns; manual reviews before publishing.

## High-Risk Items

### 2. OPS-018: `pnpm workspace:demo` Flakes or Exceeds 10-Minute SLA
**Score:** 6 (High)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – Compose orchestration may vary across machines; network dependencies add variance.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Partners face setup frustration and abandon demos.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Bundle required services locally (no external calls); provide health checks with early failure.
  - Monitor runtime metrics; adjust caching and prebuild steps.
  - Offer troubleshooting guide and preflight check script.
- **Testing Focus:** Automation running demo command on reference hardware; CI smoke test for runtime.

### 3. DATA-017: Fixture Manifests Drift from Production Schema
**Score:** 6 (High)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – As schema evolves, fixtures may not update synchronously.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Demos misrepresent actual outputs, confusing partners and developers.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Validate fixtures against current schema during CI.
  - Version fixtures with changelog; require updates per schema release.
  - Link fixture updates to responsible lending rule coverage to ensure parity.
- **Testing Focus:** Schema validation tests; diff checks between fixtures and production manifests.

### 4. TECH-014: Telemetry Tagging Fails to Separate Demo vs Production Runs
**Score:** 6 (High)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – Label injection may be inconsistent across CLI/UI flows.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Observability dashboards blend demo noise with production signals, masking incidents.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Enforce tagging middleware; add automated tests verifying labels on demo commands.
  - Update dashboards with filters enforced by default.
  - Alert on demo-tagged traffic in production hours to detect misconfigurations.
- **Testing Focus:** Integration tests executing demo flows verifying telemetry labels; dashboard snapshot tests.

## Medium-Risk Items

### 5. BUS-013: Documentation Fails to Explain Fixture Lifecycle & Support
**Score:** 4 (Medium)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – Without clear ownership, partners may rely on stale fixtures.
- **Impact:** Medium (2) – Support load increases; partners mistrust sample outputs.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Document update cadence, contact channels, and expected SLA for fixture issues.
  - Provide changelog and “what’s new” section for sample bundles.
  - Collect partner feedback to prioritise improvements.
- **Testing Focus:** Documentation reviews; partner pilot feedback sessions.

| OPS-018  | Operational | Demo scripts, Compose stack      | CI run metrics, runtime monitoring              | Developer Enablement  | Medium – hardware variance persists |
| DATA-017 | Data     | Fixtures, manifests, schema         | Schema validation tests, changelog reviews      | Platform Engineering  | Medium – reliant on release alignment |
| TECH-014 | Technical | Telemetry pipeline, dashboards      | Automated telemetry tests, dashboard audits     | Observability Team    | Medium – requires governance |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical & High Risks
- Automated PII sanitisation checks on fixtures (SEC-013).
- Demo workflow CI runs with runtime assertions (OPS-018).
- Schema validation for fixtures and telemetry label contract tests (DATA-017, TECH-014).

### Priority 2: Medium Risks
- Documentation reviews with partner pilot feedback (BUS-013).

### Priority 3: Baseline Regression
- Smoke tests running demo command end-to-end, verifying telemetry tagging and manifest alignment.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- SEC-013 sanitisation pipeline must pass compliance review.
- OPS-018/DATA-017/TECH-014 mitigations must demonstrate reliable demos, schema parity, and telemetry separation.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- BUS-013 acceptable with documented update cadence and feedback loop.

### Accepted Risks
- None accepted currently.

## Monitoring Requirements
- Track fixture update history, demo command success rates, and telemetry label ratios.
- Monitor partner support tickets referencing sample assets.

## Risk Review Triggers
- New fixture bundles or template types added.
- Demo runtime regressions or telemetry anomalies detected.
- Partner feedback indicating outdated or sensitive fixtures.

## Recommendations Summary
- Sanitize and govern fixtures rigorously before publishing.
- Keep the demo workflow stable, schema-aligned, and observability-friendly.
- Provide clear documentation and support channels for partner developers.
