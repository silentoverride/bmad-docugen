# Risk Profile: Story 3.1

Date: 2025-09-26
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 42/100

Compliance gating and operator UX serve as the control layer preventing policy breaches. The most serious threat is override flows bypassing policy gates, which would nullify responsible lending protections.

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-008: Override RBAC Allows Unauthorised Policy Bypass
**Score:** 9 (Critical)

- **Probability:** High (3) – Multi-surface override paths (CLI, UI) plus complex Keycloak scopes make misconfiguration likely.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Unchecked overrides let non-compliant bundles escape, creating regulatory exposure.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Require dual-approval overrides with mandatory justification stored in manifests.
  - Validate override attempts through policy engine enforcing role + scope combinations.
  - Monitor override frequency with alerts on spikes or out-of-hours activity.
- **Testing Focus:** Integration tests simulating overrides with valid/invalid scopes; security review of RBAC mapping.

## High-Risk Items

### 2. DATA-010: Gating Fails to Consume Latest Rule Diagnostics
**Score:** 6 (High)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – Diagnostics from Story 2.1 may evolve without UI/CLI updates.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Missing remediation details block operator resolution or hide failures.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Establish schema contracts for diagnostics with automated compatibility tests.
  - Gate deployments on updated remediation catalog references.
  - Surface diagnostic version info in telemetry for validation.
- **Testing Focus:** Contract tests between rule engine and UX; regression tests on remediation copy.

### 3. PERF-007: Operator Flow Exceeds Five-Minute Target
**Score:** 6 (High)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – Instrumentation gaps and complex flows can exceed targets.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Operators revert to manual workarounds, reducing adoption.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Instrument journey timers and publish dashboards with SLAs.
  - Optimise slow steps; shift non-critical tasks to background workers.
  - Set alerting when median/95th percentile durations breach targets.
- **Testing Focus:** Performance telemetry validation; usability tests measuring completion times.

### 4. OPS-010: Training Mode Falls Out of Sync with Production Flow
**Score:** 6 (High)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – Fixtures and scripts drift as production evolves.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Onboarding teaches outdated steps, leading to production errors.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Version training fixtures tied to production releases; add automated diff to detect divergence.
  - Schedule quarterly training walkthroughs with compliance SMEs.
  - Capture feedback logs for refinements.
- **Testing Focus:** Integration tests aligning training mode outputs with production; doc review.

## Medium-Risk Items

### 5. BUS-007: Remediation Guidance Lacks Accessibility & Localization
**Score:** 4 (Medium)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – Accessibility/localization often trail functional delivery.
- **Impact:** Medium (2) – Teams using assistive tech or regional locales struggle, increasing escalations.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Apply design system accessibility standards and i18n libraries from Epic 3.0.
  - Include screen-reader QA passes and gather operator feedback.
  - Track remediation article usage to prioritise updates.
- **Testing Focus:** Accessibility audits; localization smoke tests on remediation strings.

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical & High Risks
- RBAC override simulations with positive/negative cases (SEC-008).
- Diagnostics contract and gating regression tests (DATA-010).
- Telemetry-driven performance runs and training mode parity checks (PERF-007, OPS-010).

### Priority 2: Medium Risks
- Accessibility/i18n validation of remediation content (BUS-007).

### Priority 3: Baseline Regression
- Smoke tests ensuring gates halt on failures and present remediation guidance.
- CLI/UI tests covering training mode sample runs and instrumentation hooks.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- SEC-008 controls must be proven with automated tests and monitoring prior to enabling overrides.
- DATA-010 gating must show up-to-date diagnostics before roll-out.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- PERF-007 and OPS-010 acceptable with SLA dashboards, alerting, and scheduled reviews.
- BUS-007 acceptable if accessibility backlog is tracked and prioritised.

### Accepted Risks
- None accepted currently.

## Monitoring Requirements
- Track override approval counts, operator flow durations, and training usage metrics.
- Monitor diagnostics version mismatches and remediation article feedback.

## Risk Review Triggers
- Changes to compliance rules or override policy.
- Introduction of new operator personas or training content.
- Accessibility feedback from operators or compliance audits.

## Recommendations Summary
- Harden override governance, ensuring RBAC and telemetry catch anomalies.
- Keep diagnostics and training assets synchronized with production rules.
- Measure operator experience continuously to uphold SLA and accessibility commitments.
