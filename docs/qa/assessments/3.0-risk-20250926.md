# Risk Profile: Story 3.0

Date: 2025-09-26
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 40/100

The admin UI shell becomes the anchor for every operator and compliance workflow. Weak access controls or unstable foundations ripple through subsequent epics. The most critical exposure is incomplete authentication guardrails that allow unauthorised access to compliance data.

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-007: Authentication Guardrails Bypass Admin UI Shell
**Score:** 9 (Critical)

- **Probability:** High (3) – Shell scaffolds are frequently built before full IdP integration, leaving views exposed during early iterations.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Exposes compliance and operator tooling to unauthorised users, creating severe security incidents.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Enforce Keycloak (or chosen IdP) integration before adding protected routes; require authenticated sessions for all shell renders.
  - Add automated Playwright tests verifying redirects for anonymous users, refresh token handling, and session expiry.
  - Instrument access logs for unauthorised attempts and alert on anomalies.
- **Testing Focus:** End-to-end auth guard tests, token rotation simulations, negative-path access attempts.

## High-Risk Items

### 2. TECH-010: Design System Drift from UX Guidelines
**Score:** 6 (High)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – Copying components from other projects without aligning tokens leads to inconsistencies.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Future features inherit inconsistent UX, increasing rework and reducing operator efficiency.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Establish shared token source of truth synced with `docs/user-interface-design-goals.md`.
  - Add visual regression snapshots for core components.
  - Document component usage patterns and lint for unapproved styling overrides.
- **Testing Focus:** Unit tests for tokens; visual regression tests via Storybook/Playwright.

### 3. OPS-009: Role-Based Routing Misconfigurations
**Score:** 6 (High)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – Complex routing setups can allow unprivileged access or lock out legitimate roles.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Breaks compliance controls or blocks operator workflows, causing incident response.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Centralise role definitions and route guards; include integration tests per role persona.
  - Log authorisation decisions with role + path for auditing.
  - Provide fallback messaging with remediation guidance when access is denied.
- **Testing Focus:** Integration tests covering allowed/denied routes per role; telemetry validation of access decisions.

### 4. PERF-006: Shell Performance Degrades Initial Load
**Score:** 6 (High)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – Bootstrapping frameworks with heavy dependencies can slow load times beyond operator tolerance.
- **Impact:** High (3) – Operators abandon training flows or resort to CLI, reducing adoption of governance features.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Apply code-splitting and lazy loading for heavy modules; monitor core web vitals.
  - Use bundle analysis to keep initial payload within defined budgets.
  - Implement caching strategies for static assets via CDN.
- **Testing Focus:** Performance tests measuring First Contentful Paint and TTFB; CI bundle-size guardrails.

## Medium-Risk Items

### 5. BUS-006: Documentation Gaps Stall Feature Adoption
**Score:** 4 (Medium)

- **Probability:** Medium (2) – Documentation is often postponed during shell build-out.
- **Impact:** Medium (2) – Teams duplicate patterns or misuse the shell, causing inconsistent implementations.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Treat documentation as a deliverable with review gates; ensure architecture overview and contribution workflow are complete before handoff.
  - Embed doc links within the UI shell for quick reference.
  - Collect developer feedback to iterate on clarity.
- **Testing Focus:** Documentation linting, broken link checks, and pilot feedback sessions.

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical & High Risks
- Automated auth guard tests plus security review before exposing shell (SEC-007).
- Visual regression and routing parity tests (TECH-010, OPS-009).
- Performance regression monitoring in CI and staging (PERF-006).

### Priority 2: Medium Risks
- Documentation quality checks and pilot onboarding feedback (BUS-006).

### Priority 3: Baseline Regression
- Unit tests for layout primitives and component behaviour.
- Smoke tests verifying navigation, auth redirects, and role-based messaging.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- SEC-007 mitigations must be in place with automated coverage before wider access.
- OPS-009 controls must confirm RBAC integrity to avoid compliance violations.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- TECH-010 and PERF-006 acceptable with monitoring, linting, and tech debt backlog.
- BUS-006 acceptable when documentation completion is tracked and reviewed.

### Accepted Risks
- None accepted currently.

## Monitoring Requirements
- Track auth failure rates, navigation errors, and page load metrics.
- Monitor documentation feedback tickets and component adoption metrics.

## Risk Review Triggers
- Addition of new routes/components requiring updated RBAC.
- Changes in UX guidelines or design tokens.
- Performance regressions identified in observability dashboards.

## Recommendations Summary
- Lock down authentication before expanding admin UI capabilities.
- Guard the design system and routing architecture with automation and documentation.
- Keep performance and onboarding experience top-of-mind to ensure adoption.
